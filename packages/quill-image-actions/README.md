# Quill Image Actions

A fork of [quill-image](https://github.com/xeger/quill-image).

This is a Quill module that provides resizable, floatable images independent from the HTML DOM. It is designed to be used together with `@xeger/quill-image-formats`.

For more information, please see [combined README](https://github.com/xeger/quill-image#readme).
